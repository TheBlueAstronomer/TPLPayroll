# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

## Architecture Rules

- **Feature Slice Architecture**: Every feature built must follow the feature slice architecture. Code should be organized by feature (e.g., `features/[feature-name]/` or similar feature-centric directories) rather than by global technical concerns. Each feature slice should be self-contained, encapsulating its own components, hooks, business logic, API calls, and types.

## Testing Rules

- **Running E2E Tests**: When instructed to run E2E tests (`npm run test:e2e`), you must choose the appropriate workflow:
  - **Dev Workflow (Fast)**: If iterating on tests, ensure `npm run dev` is running, then execute `npm run test:e2e`. Playwright's `reuseExistingServer` will utilize the running dev server.
  - **Prod Workflow (Stable)**: If running the full test suite for verification or if encountering Next.js compiler panics, you MUST run `npm run build` first, ensure no dev server is running on port 3000, and then execute `npm run test:e2e` to test against the production build.
  - **Database Requirements**: A local PostgreSQL database must be actively running (e.g., via `npx prisma dev`). The `test:e2e` script handles its own DB seeding.
